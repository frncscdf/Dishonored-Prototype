# Dishonored Prototype
In this project I implement two abilities from the game Dishonored in Unity.

In Dishonored you can use an ability called **Blink** which allows you to teleport to the point in the world you are aiming at, such as props, walls, roofs, etc.

Here's a video of my implementation of three version of this ability based on how different characters in both Dishonored 1 and 2 use it:

In Dishonored 2 there is an artifact called **Timepiece** that enables the player to shift between two timelines that are set in two different maps. In addition this object can make the player see the other timeline (map) before switching to it.

Here's a video of my implementation:
